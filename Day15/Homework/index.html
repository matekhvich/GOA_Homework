        <h2>tree is so beautiful</h2>
        <p>In botany, a tree is a perennial plant with <br>
            an elongated stem, or trunk, usually supporting <br>
             branches and leaves. In some usages, the <br>
              definition of a tree may be narrower, <br>
              including only woody plants with secondary <br>
              growth, plants that are usable as lumber or <br>
               plants above a specified height. In wider <br>
                definitions, the taller palms, tree ferns, <br>
                 bananas, and bamboos are also trees.</p>
